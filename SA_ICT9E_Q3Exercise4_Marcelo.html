	<p>Though time has significantly passed since this specific memory of my life, I still cherish it today like it was yesterday. In the photographs, happy moments are shared between me, my older brother, and my younger cousin. We were quite the trio, always sticking together and playing with each other! The picture on the left was just us waiting for the bus at the bus stop. The weather that day, I recalled, was just right. Accompanied by a cool breeze, it was sunny yet we weren't bathing under a scorching sun. Of course, with all three of us lined up together looking wholesome, the adults couldn't resist but take a shot of the scene. The photo on the right this time was taken at the airport. The adults were checking in the luggage we brought as we were waiting in line. Great mounds of excitement filled the three of us as we couldn't wait for what was in store when we arrive in Japan by the next several hours.</p>
	<p>Small things to appreciate (that are also my favourite) in Japan: playgrounds/parks, convenience stores, vending machines, the delicious food, the relaxing ambience, and many more!</p>
